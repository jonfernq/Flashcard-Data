## Views 

Commands and code to accomplish the second step in the Django quiz app:

2. Create the views for the quiz page, submission page, and result page:

The quiz page view should retrieve the questions from the database and display them with checkboxes. The submission page view should process the user's answers, compare them to the correct answers, and calculate the score. The result page view should retrieve the quiz questions and the user's answers from the database, highlight the wrong answers in red, and display the corrected quiz with the total score.

Here's an example implementation of the views for the quiz page, submission page, and result page:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .models import QuizQuestion, UserQuizScore

def quiz(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Process the submitted answers and redirect to the result page
        # ...
        return redirect('result')
    else:
        # Retrieve the quiz questions from the database and display them
        quiz_questions = QuizQuestion.objects.all()
        context = {'quiz_questions': quiz_questions}
        return render(request, 'quiz.html', context)

def submission(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Process the submitted answers, compare to the correct answers, and calculate the score
        # ...
        # Save the user's quiz score to the database
        # ...
        return redirect('result')
    else:
        # Redirect back to the quiz page if the user tries to access the submission page directly
        return redirect('quiz')

def result(request):
    # Retrieve the quiz questions and the user's answers from the database
    quiz_questions = QuizQuestion.objects.all()
    user_scores = UserQuizScore.objects.all()
    
    # Calculate the total score and highlight wrong answers in red
    total_score = 0
    for question in quiz_questions:
        user_score = user_scores.filter(quiz_question=question).first()
        if user_score and user_score.selected_answer == question.correct_answer:
            total_score += 1
            question.is_correct = True
        else:
            question.is_correct = False
    
    # Display the corrected quiz with the total score
    context = {'quiz_questions': quiz_questions, 'total_score': total_score}
    return render(request, 'result.html', context)
```

In this implementation, the quiz view retrieves the quiz questions from the database and displays them on the quiz page. If the user submits their answers, the view processes the answers and redirects to the result page.

The submission view processes the submitted answers, compares them to the correct answers, calculates the score, and saves the user's quiz score to the database. If the user tries to access the submission page directly, they are redirected back to the quiz page.

The result view retrieves the quiz questions and the user's answers from the database, calculates the total score, and highlights wrong answers in red. It then displays the corrected quiz with the total score on the result page.

Note that you'll need to create the corresponding HTML templates for the quiz, submission, and result pages, and include the necessary form fields and submit buttons.You'll also need to define the URLs for these views in your Django app's urls.py file.
