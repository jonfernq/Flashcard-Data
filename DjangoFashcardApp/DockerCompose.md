## Docker Compose

Could you suggest a docker-compose.yml file for the Flashcard App? : Create a docker-compose.yml file that describes the services for your app. This should include a service for your Django app, as well as any other services that it depends on (e.g. a database).
Sure, here's an example docker-compose.yml file for the Flashcard App:

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: flashcard_db
      POSTGRES_USER: flashcard_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: flashcard_password

  web:
    build: .
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
```

This docker-compose.yml file defines two services, db and web. The db service is a PostgreSQL database that the web service depends on. The web service builds the Docker image for your Django app using the Dockerfile in the current directory (.). It then runs the python manage.py runserver command to start the Django development server on port 8000, and maps that port to the same port on the Docker host using the ports directive. The volumes directive mounts the current directory as a volume in the container, allowing you to make changes to the code on your host machine and have those changes immediately reflected in the container.

Note that this is just an example docker-compose.yml file, and you may need to modify it to suit your specific needs (e.g. if you're using a different database or if your Django app requires additional services).
