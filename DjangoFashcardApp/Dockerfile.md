## Dockerfile

A Dockerfile for the Flashcard App:

2. Create a Dockerfile that describes how to build the Docker image for your Django app. The Dockerfile should include instructions for installing any dependencies (e.g. Python packages) and copying your code into the image.

Here is an example Dockerfile for the Flashcard App:

```bash
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1

# Set the working directory to /code
WORKDIR /code

# Install required packages
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        gcc \
        libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt /code/
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /code
COPY . /code/

# Set the default command to run when the container starts
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

This Dockerfile starts with the official Python 3.9 image, sets some environment variables, installs some required packages (including gcc and libpq-dev for building Python packages), installs the Python dependencies specified in requirements.txt, copies the code into the container, and sets the default command to run the Django development server.

You may need to modify this Dockerfile depending on the specific requirements of your app. For example, you may need to install additional system packages or copy additional files into the container.
