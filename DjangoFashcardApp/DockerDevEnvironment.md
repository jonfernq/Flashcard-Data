### Docker Development Environment

For the creation of the flashcard app, additional steps needed to do development work in a Docker Container  

To develop the flashcard app outlined above in a Docker container, you will need to follow these additional steps:

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your local machine.

2. Create a Dockerfile that describes how to build the Docker image for your Django app. The Dockerfile should include instructions for installing any dependencies (e.g. Python packages) and copying your code into the image.

3. Create a docker-compose.yml file that describes the services for your app. This should include a service for your Django app, as well as any other services that it depends on (e.g. a database).

4. Build the Docker image for your app using the Dockerfile:

```php
docker build -t <image_name> .
```

5. Start the services for your app using Docker Compose:

```
docker-compose up
```

6. Verify that your app is running by visiting the appropriate URL in your web browser.

7. Use Docker commands (e.g. docker exec, docker logs) to interact with your app and troubleshoot any issues that arise during development.

8. Once you are satisfied with your app, you can deploy it to a production environment using Docker. This will involve building a new Docker image and deploying it to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Amazon ECS.
